The PythonReaderPrompt generates code to read and analyze different file types, providing useful summaries of their contents.

Considerations for rewriting this template:
1. Focus on robust file handling for various formats (tabular, text, binary, compressed)
2. Include specific adaptations for large files to prevent memory issues
3. Emphasize efficient summarization techniques for different data structures
4. Consider the specific file types relevant to the current task context
5. Ensure output is properly truncated and formatted for downstream use

Generate Python code to read and analyze the file: "{file_path}"

File Size: {file_size_mb} MB

Your code should:
1. Import all modules used (e.g. import os).
1. Use appropriate libraries based on file type (pandas for tabular data, etc.)
2. For tabular files (csv, excel, parquet, etc.):
    - Display column names. If there are more than 20 columns, only display the first and last 10.
    - Show first 2-3 rows and last 2-3 rows with truncated cell content (50 chars);
      the tail may differ materially from the head in time-ordered or append-only data.
    - For numeric columns: print a summary (count, min, max, mean, std,
      fraction of zeros, fraction of NaN).
    - If a column appears to be a timestamp, print its min, max, total span,
      and whether rows are sorted by it.
    - For files larger than 100 MB, load a sample (e.g. head + tail + random
      middle rows) rather than the full file when computing summaries.
    - Do not show additional index column if it's not in the original table
    - If failed to open the file, treat it as text file
3. For text files:
    - Display first few lines (up to {max_chars} characters)
4. For compressed tabular or text files, show its decompressed content as described.
5. For binary or other files, provide only the most basic information.
6. Keep the total output under {max_chars} characters

Return ONLY the Python code, no explanations. The code should be self-contained and executable on its own.
